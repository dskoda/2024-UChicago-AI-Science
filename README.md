# Tutorials for the UChicago AI + Science Summer School 2024

This repository contains the code for the tutorial on [Atomistic Adversarial Attacks](https://github.com/dskoda/Atomistic-Adversarial-Attacks) and [QUESTS: Quick Uncertainty and Entropy from STructural Similarity](https://github.com/dskoda/quests) presented to the UChicago AI + Science Summer School 2024.
The notebooks are available in Google Colab in the following links:

- Atomistic Adversarial Attacks: <https://bit.ly/UChicago-AtomAttacks>
- QUESTS: <https://bit.ly/UChicago-QUESTS>

The tutorials have some precomputed information in folder named [results](results) and datasets in the folders [gap20](gap20) and [rmd17](rmd17).
Only part of the datasets are available in this repository for brevity.
